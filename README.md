OBJECTIVE - Become A Competitive GO Programmer

“ For me, great algorithms are the poetry of
  computation. Just like verse, they can be terse,
  allusive, dense, and even mysterious.

  But once unlocked, they cast a brilliant new
  light on some aspect of computing. ”

— Francis Sullivan


----------------------------------------------


“ An algorithm must be seen to be believed. ”

— Donald Knuth


----------------------------------------------


“ I will, in fact, claim that the difference
between a bad programmer and a good one is
whether he considers his code or his data
structures more important.

Bad programmers worry about the code.

Good programmers worry about data structures
and their relationships. ”

— Linus Torvalds

“ Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs. ”

— Niklaus Wirth
